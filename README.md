# Twitter-sentiment-Extraction
In this competition you will need to pick out the part of the tweet (word or phrase) that reflects the sentiment.
What words in tweets support a positive, negative, or neutral sentiment? How can we help make that determination using machine learning tools? 
Our objective in this competition is to construct a model that can look at the labeled sentiment for a given tweet and figure out what word or phrase best supports it.
